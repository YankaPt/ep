## Abstract

This document describes the `lhexec` - core component ([ep-lh-0017](#related)) that allows to analyze files/standard input by engines.

## Motivation

Linterhub is a catalog that contains the information necessary to install, run and process the result of the work of the `linter`. To start working, you need a utility that launches linters for certain files/stdin.

## Proposal

`lhexec` is a utility that launches linters for certain files/stdin.

## Strategies

lhexec implements the following strategies:

| Name         | Description                          |
| -            | -                                    |
| analyze      | analyze smth                         |
| help         | Show help                            |
| version      | Get lhexec version                   |

> `help` and `version` strategies are common for all `core components` and described in ([ep-lh-0017](#related)).
                                                        
### analyze

The analyze strategy allows to analyze certain files, files in certain folder or stdin. 

| Argument    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| engine      | []string   | +        | List of the engines to be analyzed. [ep-lh-0002](#related) |
| project     | string   | +        | Path to the project |
| folder     | string   | -        | Relative path to the specific folder |
| file | string   | -        | Specific file for analysis|
| environment | string   | -        | The way how to analyze ([ep-lh-0009#install](#related)) |
| stdin     | bool   | -        | This argument says that standard input will be analyzed (`false` by default) |


Here is command examples for installing engine 'enginename' as global package.

`lhexec a --engine=enginename1 -e=enginename2 --project=./project-path --file=file1.js`

Structure of output is described in [ep-lh-0019](#related)
