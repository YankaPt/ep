## Abstract

This document describes the `lhexec` - core component ([ep-lh-0017](#related)) that allows to analyze files/standard input by engines.

## Motivation

Linterhub is a catalog that contains the information necessary to install, run and process the result of the work of the `linter`. To start working, you need a utility that launches linters for certain files/stdin.

## Proposal

lhexec is a utility that launches linters for certain files/stdin.

## Strategies

lhexec implements the following strategies:

| Name         | Description                          |
| -            | -                                    |
| analyze      | analyze smth                  |
| help         | Show help                            |
| version      | Get lhexec version                    |

> `help` and `version` strategies are common for all `core components` and described in ([ep-lh-0017](#related)).
                                                        |
### analyze

The analyze strategy allows to analyze certain files, files in certain folder or stdin. 

| Argument    | Type     | Required | Description |
| -           | :-:      | :-:      | -           |
| engine      | string   | +        | Name of the engine to be analyzed. [ep-lh-0002](#related) |
| project     | string   | -        | Path to the project(current folder by default) |
| folder     | string   | -        | Path to the specific folder |
| file | string   | -        | Specific file for analysis|
| environment | string   | -        | The way how to analyze (needs to be clarified) |
| stdin     | bool   | -        | This argument says that standard input will be analyzed(false by default) |


Here is command examples for installing engine 'enginename' as global package.

`lhexec a --engine enginename1 -e enginename2 --file ./folder1/file1.js`


Structure of output is described in [ep-lh-0019](#related)
